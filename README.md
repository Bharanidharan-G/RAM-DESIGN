# RAM-DESIGN

COMPANY: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

NAME: BHARANIDHARAN

INTERN ID: CT08OPX

DOMAIN: VLSI

DURATION: 4 WEEKS

MENTOR: NEELA SANTOSH

OVERVIEW

This project involves designing a 4-stage pipelined processor that supports basic instructions, including:
ADD (Addition)
SUB (Subtraction)
LOAD (Memory Load Operation)
  
The processor is implemented using Verilog/VHDL and follows a 4-stage pipeline design:
Fetch (IF) – Instruction fetching from memory.
Decode (ID) – Instruction decoding and operand fetching.
Execute (EX) – ALU operation execution.
Write-back (WB) – Writing results back to registers/memory.

PROJECT REQUIREMENTS

Design a 4-stage pipelined processor in Verilog/VHDL.
Implement data forwarding and hazard detection if required.
Simulate and verify each pipeline stage.
  
DELIVERABLES

✅ Processor Verilog/VHDL Code
✅ Testbench for Functional Verification
✅ Simulation Showing Each Pipeline Stage

INSTRUCTIONS

Clone this repository.
Use an HDL simulator (ModelSim, Xilinx Vivado, etc.) to compile the design.
Run the testbench to verify pipeline execution.
Analyze simulation results for correct stage operation.
